In the United States before the mid 1990's, doctors were hesitant to prescribed pain killers to patients. In 1996, OxyCotin was created and massive campaignes were launched promoting the usage of pain killers and abating the concern from doctors. The campaign was so successful by 2000 6 million OxyCotin prescriptions were writen each year. 

*The dataset focus*
The State of Connecticut has been dealing with a drug abuse epidemic, that on average, it claims two lives every day from drug overdose.
From 2012 to 2018 Connecticut has experience 5,106 accidental deaths from drug abuse. The death toll has concerned members of the state and the nation, pressuring lawmakers to pass bills in effort to abate the crisis.
